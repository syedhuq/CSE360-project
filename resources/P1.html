<h4>What is an object?</h4>
<font size="-1">
<p>An object can be considered a "thing" that can perform a </p>
<p>set of related activities. The set of activities that the </p>
<p>object performs defines the object's behavior. For example, </p>
<p>the Hand (object) can grip something, or a Student (object) </p>
<p>can give their name or address.</p>
